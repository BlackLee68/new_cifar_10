# new_cifar_10
use CNNS to test on the new cifar pickle, the new pickle file is different from the 
original dataset, I add the mirror images in the new dataset, so the new dataset have
90000 samples. And after five hours running, I got a result of 76% accuracy.

And the pickle files are been made through the sometest_on_image.ipynb. you can change the 
code to have more different pickle files.
